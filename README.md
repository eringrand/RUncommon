# uncommonR
A package of personal functions I use at work or in my personal projects. The fuctions are based in tidyverse style and therefor many tidyverse packages and functions are required. 

To download this package for your own use, type.

```
devtools::install_github('eringrand/uncommonR', dependencies = FALSE)
library(uncommonR)
```
