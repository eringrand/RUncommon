RUncommon
================

A package of personal functions I use at work or in my personal projects. The functions are based in tidyverse style and therefor many tidyverse packages and functions are required or suggested.

To download this package for your own use, type.

``` r
devtools::install_git("eringrand/RUncommon")
library(RUncommon)
```
